Trusted execution environments allow the execution of code in an environment
isolated from the remaining system and effectively aim to protect data against
unauthorized access and program code from being tampered with without detection.
To form a trusted relationship with the user, trusted execution environments
offer remote attestation, by which they can prove claims about the code running
inside of the environment and its state to the user.\\

Most hardware vendors offer special hardware extensions to allow the creation of
trusted execution environments. For commodity CPUs, these extensions are called
SGX and TDX in Intel processors, SEV-SNP in AMD processors, and TrustZone in Arm
devices. Vendors of these CPU extensions make a strong claim about their
security properties. With the advent of microarchitectural vulnerabilities in
2017, these claims have been proven by research to be broken or only held under
special circumstances. So-called transient execution attacks abuse the
microarchitectural behavior of modern CPUs. Software mitigations to certain
vulnerabilities exist but do not mitigate the source of the problems but rather
channels through which they extract information. Consequently, researchers
discover new vulnerabilities each year. \\

In this thesis, I develop a software-based approach to trusted execution
environments. Instead of using vendor-specific hardware extensions, my approach
is to use features present in nearly all commodity processors. By isolating a
single CPU core to run my environment, I create a highly isolated environment
that mitigates some of the attacks by design. For remaining attacks, I use
performance monitoring counters to detect data breaches. Together with this
isolation solution, I sketch a protocol that allows for remote attestation using
the Trusted Platform Module as a trust anchor and, therefore, allowing the
creation of a trusted execution environment without any vendor-specific hardware
extensions.\\

I show that this solution can reliably detect data breaches and isolate against
other forms of side-channel attacks. I also evaluate my prototype with regard to
what constraints it imposes on workloads. Finally, I will show that with the
currently available hardware, my solution can not alone protect sufficiently
from attacks and needs to be paired with additional solutions. I evaluate what
of the already existing solutions can be paired with my solution to increase
overall security properties.
