Remote attestation is used in confidential computing to prove to a client over a
computer network that a system in question fulfills a set of defined properties.
In a computer system, software can use remote attestation to verify that, for
example, the bootflow of a system was not compromised by malware. One
requirement for remote attestation is a hardware device that forms the root of
trust\cite{coker2011principles}. For the bootflow example, the hardware root of
trust in x86 systems is given by a Trusted Platform Module which, short TPM.

A technology enabling the concept of remote attestation to a per-application
basis is Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX). It allows applications to run
code in a secure enclave, isolated from the operating system or hypervisor. SGX
protects the integrity of the code to run in an enclave by providing remote
attestation about the state of the enclave. An explication can decide on the
provided attestation results if it wants to exchange secrets with the enclave.
Confidentiality of secrets exchanged with the enclave through is protected by
cryptography when using SGX. The root of trust is formed by the correctly
implemented special SGX instructions. Enclave keys are embedded in the firmware,
protected by the Intel management engine.\cite{costan2016intel}

In recent years many flaws in the implementation of SGX were discovered by
security researchers. With the advent of side-channel attacks, such as Spectre,
a new attack vector was discovered. While not part of the threat model of SGX,
special Spectre attacks can be used to leak enclave
content.\cite{chen2019sgxpectre, van2018foreshadow} Even without side channels,
architectural vulnerabilities can be used to leak SGX content and even
keys.\cite{borrello2022aepic}

All these vulnerabilities work because they expose data through the memory
subsystem. To mitigate this attack vector, I want to elaborate on the
possibility of constructing an enclave-like partition that runs code entirely in
local cache structures. For this, I want to isolate a single CPU core so that it
can not be tampered with from other system components. Software running in this
enclave shall be able to maintain its confidentiality by observing performance
counters, from which it can decide to react appropriately if it detects a data
breach. Moreover, I want to review algorithms for remote attestation applicable
to the isolated CPU core, so that its state can be attested to applications
running outside of the enclave. Combining both results in an enclave immune to
side channel attacks running on commodity hardware without the need for
additional hardware support. With the additional support of a hardware root of
trust like the TPM, this concept can achieve security guarantees similar to
Intel SGX.
