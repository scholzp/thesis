\section{Technical Background}
\label{sec:state:technical}
This chapter will give us an overview of important mechanisms used by modern
CPUs. While there are other widely used architectures, such as ARM on
mobile devices, we will explore these features in the example of the x86\_64
architecture. \\

We decided to do so because our proof of concept implementation will target
the x86\_64 architecture. Moreover, behavior and implementations of similar
concepts can differ between \gls{isa} (\acrshort{a_isa}) and even
implementations of the same \acrshort{a_isa} on the microarchitectural plane.
We will, therefore, note differences in implementations of x86\_64 whenever
appropriate. Until then, we will stick to the general behavior described in
the AMD64 specification so that the Intel 64-bit extensions are largely
compatible.
