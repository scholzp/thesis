\section{Summery}
Next to the introduction to the technical aspects of x86 processors, we have seen
examples for \glspl{tee}, attacks on \glspl{tee}, and possible mitigations to
those attacks. \\

All \gls{tee} solutions have in common that they do not implement the whole
functionality exclusively in hardware. For example, Intel and AMD employ
dedicated security processors in their x86 \gls{soc} to implement \gls{sgx} and
\gls{sev} features, respectively. Together with Enma, which uses the \gls{tpm}
as a root of trust, these solutions implement a signature-based remote
attestation scheme. Next, they all share the property of being vulnerable to
side-channel attacks, with Spectre and Meltdown being rather prominent. These
attacks abuse observable (micro-) architectural side effects to leak secrets
through covert channels. Mitigations for some attacks exist, but they impact
performance or cannot be applied to all side-channel attacks. Additionally,
systems can observe these side effects through \glspl{pmc} to some degree, but
as we have seen in section~\ref{sec:20:def_sca}, attacks can avoid being
detected through reducing their throughput or simply if the noise in the the
system is too high. With QuanShield interrupt, based side channels were
mitigated by Cui et al. by creating an interrupt-free environment, which at
least mitigates this attack vector for \gls{sgx}.\\

Putting these together, I identified an approach that was not tested to the best
of my knowledge. This excludes architectural side channels by creating a
completely isolated execution environment that only uses core local resources
and monitors its integrity by utilizing \glspl{pmc}.
