\chapter{Source Code}
% \Ä¼abel{sec:appendix}

The source code and building instructions for Linux are publicly available at
GitHub. For reasons of reproducibility, I also provide the source code I used to
create measurements presented in chapter~\ref{sec:evaluation}. Each test
scenario can be found on a dedicated branch.\\
Additionally, the source code of the Linux kernel module can be found as listed
below. With the help of the build scripts in this repository any person
interested can setup a Qemu based test environment, as well as images for
running a Linux kernel next to TEECore on bare metal.

\subsubsection{Main Branch of TEECore}

\end{quote}

\noindent
This repository contains all Code of TEECore. The main branch contains code that
implements the reset procedure described in
chapter~\ref{sec:implementation:teeKernel}.

\subsubsection{SC1 Branch of TEECore}
\begin{quote}
  \url{https://github.com/scholzp/phipsboot/tree/mem_eval_sc1}
\end{quote}

\noindent
This branch contains all Code of TEECore used for SC1 in
chapter~\ref{sec:evaluation}.

\subsubsection{SC2 Branch of TEECore}
\begin{quote}
  \url{https://github.com/scholzp/phipsboot/tree/mem_eval_sc2}
\end{quote}

\noindent
This branch contains all Code of TEECore used for SC2 in
chapter~\ref{sec:evaluation}.

\subsubsection{Linux Kernel Module and Test Environment}
\begin{quote}
  \url{https://github.com/scholzp/thesis/tree/impl}
\end{quote}

\noindent
This branch contains all Code to build a Qemu based test environment, as well as
scripts to create images bootable on bare metal. In the test environment,
TEECore is run next to Linux, as described in~\ref{sec:30:tee_general}.
