\section{Structure}
\label{sec:10_structure}

In this section, I give an overview of the content of this work and how it is
structured. First, in chapter~\ref{sec:state}, I will provide an introduction to
the topic in general. In this chapter, the reader will learn about technical
details relevant later in this thesis, as well as attacks against which I
provide a solution. Chapter~\ref{chap:related} discusses related work, including
already existing solutions for trusted execution environments. After learning
about these solutions and their vulnerabilities, I propose a design of a
mitigating solution in chapter~\ref{sec:design} before I highlight the technical
details of my prototype implementation of this design in
chapter~\ref{sec:implementation}. The implementation chapter is followed by
chapter~\ref{sec:evaluation}, in which I reflect on the security properties of
my prototype, as well as evaluating different other technical aspects of my
solution. In chapter~\ref{sec:futurework}, I give an overview of future work,
including missing features and possibilities for future evaluation of the
prototype. Finally, I conclude my work in chapter~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
