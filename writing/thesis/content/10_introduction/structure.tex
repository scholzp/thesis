\section{Structure}
\label{sec:10_structure}
In chapter~\ref{sec:state}, we will discuss technical Grundlagen that is important to follow the rest of the work. The first part
~\ref{sec:20:technical} we will discuss some details of the x86 microarchitecture. These details will allow us to understand the attacks
and what countermeasures to implement in the remaining parts of the thesis. Section~\ref{sec:20:tee} will then discuss the state of
the art by reviewing related work. In this, we will look at how trusted execution environments are implemented.
First, we will review hardware extensions followed by software solutions or software that enhances the security of
hardware extensions.

In chapter~\ref{sec:design}, I will explain the design of my implementation. In particular, we will explain in~\ref{sec:30:system} the general
design. In~\ref{sec:30:attacker}, we will revisit the attacker model and what design feature can be used to mitigate which attack.

Chapter~\ref{sec:implementation} will explain how I implemented the design proposed in~\ref{sec:design}. We will look at specific parts of
the implementation that are important to fulfill the security guarantees. Moreover, we will investigate what part
of the design was problematic to implement.

In chapter~\ref{sec:evaluation}, we will revisit the implementation described in chapter~\ref{sec:implementation}. We will evaluate the implementation in
chapter~\ref{sec:50:security} regarding how it protects against the attacker model described in~\ref{sec:30:attacker}. Moreover, we will evaluate
the practical use of our design in~\ref{sec:50:security}.

After we evaluate the implementation, we will look at missing parts and how to improve the implementation further. We
will do all of this in section~\ref{sec:futurework}, which gives an outlook on future work.

To come to terms with our results, we will give a short overview and summary of the results and findings of our work in
chapter~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
