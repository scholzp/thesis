As described in the motivation (see chapter~\ref{sec:10:motivation}) for this
thesis, I see a big problem in the general vulnerability by side channel
attacks on commodity processors. To fully exclude side channels, I propose
<Fancy Name\todo{think about a really fancy name}> to tackle the following
goals:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item I create an execution environment fully isolated from the remaining
          system by utilizing features found in all commodity CPUs. The backend
          implementation might still be vendor-specific because those features
          might be specific to the respective CPU implementation. The overall
          concept stays the same on all CPUs. I show, that once running, system
          software cannot influence my design.
    \item I propose a \gls{tee} design to detect side-channel attacks and react
          appropriately.
    \item My design ensures the usage of only core local resources. This means
          I implement a policy that is restricted to core local caches.
    \item I evaluate ways to enable such an execution environment to offer
          remote attestation features.
    \item I evaluate my implementation regarding system resources. In detail,
          I will evaluate what workload fits next to the runtime
          environment in the core's local caches.
    \item I evaluate the TCB against what attacker model my sole software
          solution can defend.
\end{enumerate}

With complete isolation and the exclusion of possible side channels, I aim for a
\gls{tee} solution that can withstand various attacks. I show the properties and
concepts on a working proof of concept implementation. My solution can run next
to a commodity operating system such as Linux. The prototype implements
communication channels through a well-defined interface that does not influence
the security properties of my design, and I show that the prototype can protect
itself from being interfered with by the commodity OS. My solution still depends
on the commodity OS to install the environment. Therefore, the prototype will
not be a standalone solution but a technology demonstrator. Designing systems
components in a way that makes my implementation a standalone component is not
the scope of this work and is left for future work.
