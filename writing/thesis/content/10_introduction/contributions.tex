As described in the motivation (see chapter~\ref{sec:10:motivation}) for this
work, we see a big problem in the general vulnerability against the side channel
attacks of commodity processors.
To fully exclude side channels, we propose <Fancy Name\todo{think about a
    really fancy name}> to tackle the following goals:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We create an execution environment fully isolated from the
          remaining system by utilizing features found in all commodity CPUs. This
          means that we do not use any vendor-specific ISA extensions.
    \item We propose a TEE design to detect side-channel attacks and react
          appropriately.
    \item Our design ensures the usage of only core local resources. This means
          we implement a policy that is restricted to core local caches.
    \item We evaluate ways to enable such an execution environment to offer
          remote attestation features.
    \item We evaluate our implementation regarding system resources. In detail,
          we will evaluate what workload fits next to the local cache's runtime environment.
    \item We evaluate the TCB and against what attacker model our sole software
          solution can defend.
\end{enumerate}
