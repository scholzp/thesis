As described in the motivation (see chapter~\ref{sec:10:motivation}) for this
thesis, we see a big problem in the general vulnerability by side channel
attacks on commodity processors. To fully exclude side channels, we propose
<Fancy Name\todo{think about a really fancy name}> to tackle the following
goals:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We create an execution environment fully isolated from the remaining
          system by utilizing features found in all commodity CPUs. This means
          that we do not use any vendor-specific ISA extensions.
    \item We propose a TEE design to detect side-channel attacks and react
          appropriately.
    \item Our design ensures the usage of only core local resources. This means
          we implement a policy that is restricted to core local caches.
    \item We evaluate ways to enable such an execution environment to offer
          remote attestation features.
    \item We evaluate our implementation regarding system resources. In detail,
          we will evaluate what workload fits next to the local cache's runtime
          environment.
    \item We evaluate the TCB and against what attacker model our sole software
          solution can defend.
\end{enumerate}

With complete isolation and the exclusion of possible side channels, we aim for
a TEE solution that can withstand a wide array of possible attacks. Because of
time constraints in this thesis, we cannot implement a fully working TEE ;
instead, we can show the properties and concepts on a working proof of concept
implementation. We show that our solution can run next to a commodity operating
system such as Linux, implement communication channels through a well-defined
interface, and show that we can protect our implementation from being interfered
with by the commodity OS. Because we explore the technical feasibility, our
solution still depends on the commodity to install the environment.
