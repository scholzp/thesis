                    Martin Pohlack, Norman Feske

The 'inline' back end allows for converting snippets of GOSH-style text to
Latex code. It is meant to be used from Emacs to ease the writing of Latex
documents. By using the 'inline' back end, you can edit normal GOSH text and
once you are finished with your paragraph, you can press 'F6' to convert the
selected text portion automatically to Latex code without writing Latex command
by hand.

The following Emacs macro is glue betweeen Emacs and the GOSH:

! (defun gosh-to-tex ()
!   "Calls a gosh converter on the active region and replaces the
!    region with its output."
!   (interactive)
!   (shell-command-on-region
!    (mark) (point) "gosh --style inline -" t t)
!   (if (< (mark) (point))
!       (indent-region (mark) (point))
!     (indent-region (point) (mark))))
!
! (global-set-key [f6] 'gosh-to-tex)
